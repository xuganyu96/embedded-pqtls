% DISCLAIMER
% To the best of our knowledge, this template satisfies the current uWaterloo thesis requirements.
% However, it is your responsibility to assure that you have met all requirements of the University and your particular department.

% Many thanks for the feedback from many graduates who assisted the development of this template.
% Also note that there are explanatory comments and tips throughout this template.
%======================================================================
% Some important notes on using this template and making it your own...

% The University of Waterloo has required electronic thesis submission since October 2006. 
% See the uWaterloo thesis regulations at
% https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies/thesis.
% This thesis template is geared towards generating a PDF version optimized for viewing on an electronic display, including hyperlinks within the PDF.

% DON'T FORGET TO ADD YOUR OWN NAME AND TITLE in the "hyperref" package configuration below. 
% Search for: PDFTITLE, PDFAUTHOR, PDFSUBJECT, and PDFKEYWORDS.
% THIS INFORMATION GETS EMBEDDED IN THE FINAL PDF DOCUMENT.
% You can view the information if you view properties of the PDF document.

% Many faculties/departments also require one or more printed copies. 
% This template attempts to satisfy both types of output. 
% See additional notes below.
% It is based on the standard "book" document class which provides all necessary sectioning structures and allows multi-part theses.

% If you are using this template in Overleaf (cloud-based collaboration service), then it is automatically processed and previewed for you as you edit.

% For people who prefer to install their own LaTeX distributions on their own computers, and process the source files manually, the following notes provide the sequence of tasks:
 
% E.g. to process a thesis called "mythesis.tex" based on this template, run:

% pdflatex mythesis	-- first pass of the pdflatex processor
% bibtex mythesis	-- generates bibliography from .bib data file(s)
% makeindex         -- should be run only if an index is used 
% pdflatex mythesis	-- fixes numbering in cross-references, bibliographic references, glossaries, index, etc.
% pdflatex mythesis	-- it takes a couple of passes to completely process all cross-references

% If you use the recommended LaTeX editor, Texmaker, you would open the mythesis.tex file, then click the PDFLaTeX button. Then run BibTeX (under the Tools menu).
% Then click the PDFLaTeX button two more times. 
% If you have an index as well,you'll need to run MakeIndex from the Tools menu as well, before running pdflatex
% the last two times.

% N.B. The "pdftex" program allows graphics in the following formats to be included with the "\includegraphics" command: PNG, PDF, JPEG, TIFF
% Tip: Generate your figures and photos in the size you want them to appear in your thesis, rather than scaling them with \includegraphics options.
% Tip: Any drawings you do should be in scalable vector graphic formats: SVG, PNG, WMF, EPS and then converted to PNG or PDF, so they are scalable in the final PDF as well.
% Tip: Photographs should be cropped and compressed so as not to be too large.

% To create a PDF output that is optimized for double-sided printing: 
% 1) comment-out the \documentclass statement in the preamble below, and un-comment the second \documentclass line.
% 2) change the value assigned below to the boolean variable "PrintVersion" from " false" to "true".

%======================================================================
%   D O C U M E N T   P R E A M B L E
% Specify the document class, default style attributes, and page dimensions, etc.
% For hyperlinked PDF, suitable for viewing on a computer, use this:
\documentclass[letterpaper,12pt,titlepage,oneside,final]{book}
 
% For PDF, suitable for double-sided printing, change the PrintVersion variable below to "true" and use this \documentclass line instead of the one above:
%\documentclass[letterpaper,12pt,titlepage,openright,twoside,final]{book}

% Some LaTeX commands I define for my own nomenclature.
% If you have to, it's easier to make changes to nomenclature once here than in a million places throughout your thesis!
\newcommand{\package}[1]{\textbf{#1}} % package names in bold text
\newcommand{\cmmd}[1]{\textbackslash\texttt{#1}} % command name in tt font 
\newcommand{\href}[1]{#1} % does nothing, but defines the command so the print-optimized version will ignore \href tags (redefined by hyperref pkg).
%\newcommand{\texorpdfstring}[2]{#1} % does nothing, but defines the command
% Anything defined here may be redefined by packages added below...

% This package allows if-then-else control structures.
\usepackage{ifthen}
\newboolean{PrintVersion}
\setboolean{PrintVersion}{false}
% CHANGE THIS VALUE TO "true" as necessary, to improve printed results for hard copies by overriding some options of the hyperref package, called below.

%\usepackage{nomencl} % For a nomenclature (optional; available from ctan.org)
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,amstext} % Lots of math symbols and environments
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} % For including graphics N.B. pdftex graphics driver 

% Hyperlinks make it very easy to navigate an electronic document.
% In addition, this is where you should specify the thesis title and author as they appear in the properties of the PDF document.
% Use the "hyperref" package 
% N.B. HYPERREF MUST BE THE LAST PACKAGE LOADED; ADD ADDITIONAL PKGS ABOVE
\usepackage[pdftex,pagebackref=false]{hyperref} % with basic options
%\usepackage[pdftex,pagebackref=true]{hyperref}
		% N.B. pagebackref=true provides links back from the References to the body text. This can cause trouble for printing.

\usepackage[automake,toc,abbreviations]{glossaries-extra} % Exception to the rule of hyperref being the last add-on package
% If glossaries-extra is not in your LaTeX distribution, get it from CTAN (http://ctan.org/pkg/glossaries-extra), 
% although it's supposed to be in both the TeX Live and MikTeX distributions. There are also documentation and 
% installation instructions there.

% Setting up the page margins...
% uWaterloo thesis requirements specify a minimum of 1 inch (72pt) margin at the
% top, bottom, and outside page edges and a 1.125 in. (81pt) gutter margin (on binding side). 
% While this is not an issue for electronic viewing, a PDF may be printed, and so we have the same page layout for both printed and electronic versions, we leave the gutter margin in.
% Set margins to minimum permitted by uWaterloo thesis regulations:
\setlength{\marginparwidth}{0pt} % width of margin notes
% N.B. If margin notes are used, you must adjust \textwidth, \marginparwidth
% and \marginparsep so that the space left between the margin notes and page
% edge is less than 15 mm (0.6 in.)
\setlength{\marginparsep}{0pt} % width of space between body text and margin notes
\setlength{\evensidemargin}{0.125in} % Adds 1/8 in. to binding side of all 
% even-numbered pages when the "twoside" printing option is selected
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{0.125in} % Adds 1/8 in. to the left of all pages when "oneside" printing is selected, and to the left of all odd-numbered pages when "twoside" printing is selected
\setlength{\textwidth}{6.375in} % assuming US letter paper (8.5 in. x 11 in.) and side margins as above
\raggedbottom

% The following statement specifies the amount of space between paragraphs. Other reasonable specifications are \bigskipamount and \smallskipamount.
\setlength{\parskip}{\medskipamount}

% The following statement controls the line spacing.  
% The default spacing corresponds to good typographic conventions and only slight changes (e.g., perhaps "1.2"), if any, should be made.
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1} % this is the default line space setting

% By default, each chapter will start on a recto (right-hand side) page.
% We also force each section of the front pages to start on a recto page by inserting \cleardoublepage commands.
% In many cases, this will require that the verso (left-hand) page be blank, and while it should be counted, a page number should not be printed.
% The following statements ensure a page number is not printed on an otherwise blank verso page.
\let\origdoublepage\cleardoublepage
\newcommand{\clearemptydoublepage}{%
  \clearpage{\pagestyle{empty}\origdoublepage}}
\let\cleardoublepage\clearemptydoublepage

% Define Glossary terms (This is properly done here, in the preamble and could also be \input{} from a separate file...)
% Main glossary entries -- definitions of relevant terminology
\newglossaryentry{computer}

\chapter{Implementation and benchmarking}\label{sec:implementation-and-benchmarking}
To evaluate post-quantum TLS 1.3 and KEMTLS on constrained devices, we implemented post-quantum TLS 1.3 and KEMTLS on top of WolfSSL, a TLS library written in the C programming language. We then implemented a minimal TLS client on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W, a microcontroller with two ARM Cortex-M33 cores \footnote{The Pico 2 W also has 2 RISC-V cores, though we did not use them in this project.} and 512kB of SRAM, and measures the time it takes for the Pico client to complete a TLS 1.3 or KEMTLS handshake with a server. This chapter describes some of the implementation details, the benchmarking methodology, and the performance measurements.

\section{WolfSSL}\label{sec:wolfssl}
WolfSSL is a modern open-source TLS library written in C. In addition to a complete TLS stack, WolfSSL also includes its own cryptography library called WolfCrypt. Both WolfSSL and WolfCrypt are optimized for code size, speed, and memory footprint, and it portability and ease of configuration greatly simplifies managing multiple build targets using a single code base.

\subsection{Integrating post-quantum algorithms}\label{sec:integrating-post-quantum-algorithms}
As of June 2025, WolfCrypt contains an in-house implementation of ML-KEM and ML-DSA. Both implementation are skillfully optimized, achieving at least 2x speedup on the Pico compared to the reference implementation \footnote{The Keccak implementation in WolfCrypt is only roughly 10\% faster than PQClean's implementation, so the optimization must have come elsewhere}. Unfortunately, this makes the comparison across different schemes unfair. Instead, I chose to integrate with PQClean's clean implementations.

While PQClean is not specifically optimized for embedded system builds, all of its clean implementations are trivially portable to ARM. One non-trivial challenge is adapting the \texttt{randombytes} API in PQClean to am embedded system build with no operating system. Fortunately, WolfCrypt's \texttt{WC\_RNG} API provides a common abstraction that works on both a desktop build (where random bits can be sourced from \texttt{/dev/urandom}) and Pico (where random bits are collected from various peripherals by the SDK). In the end, we expanded the \texttt{randombytes} API so it can be told to source random bits from user specified instance of \texttt{WC\_RNG}.

% \begin{figure}[h]
%     \centering
%     \begin{minipage}{0.7\textwidth}
%     \begin{verbatim}
% #include <wolfssl/wolfcrypt/random.h>
% static WC_RNG *g_rng;

% void set_wc_rng(WC_RNG *input) {
%     g_rng = input;
% }

% int randombytes(uint8_t *output, size_t n) {
%     /* ... */
%     #ifdef HAVE_WC_RNG
%     (void)buf;
%     return wc_RNG_GenerateBlock(g_rng, output, n);
%     #elif defined(__EMSCRIPTEN__)
%     /* ... */
% }
%     \end{verbatim}        
%     \end{minipage}
%     \caption{Adapting \texttt{WC\_RNG} to PQClean's \texttt{randombytes} API. User is responsible for making sure that the RNG is properly initialized and freed.}
%     \label{fig:adapting-wc-rng-to-randombytes}
% \end{figure}

Expanding the selection of KEMs for the initial key exchange (i.e. \texttt{ClientHello} and \texttt{ServerHello}) is straightforward, thanks to the fact that WolfSSL already supports ML-KEM for key exchange. The \texttt{NamedGroup} enum is trivially captured using a single 16-bit integer, and the logic for branching into the correct KEM allows for a simple \texttt{switch-case} block.

% \begin{figure}[h]
%     \centering
%     \begin{verbatim}
% /* Create a key share entry using pqc parameters group on the client side.
%  * Generates a key pair.
%  */

%     WOLFSSL_ENTER("TLSX_KeyShare_GenPqcKeyClient");

Expanding the selection of post-quantum signatures is trivial thanks to previous efforts to integrate \texttt{liboqs} into WolfSSL. We only need to replace all uses of \texttt{liboqs} with their equivalents in PQClean.

\subsection{Implementing KEMTLS}\label{sec:implementing-kemtls}
\subsubsection{Generating certificate chain and private keys}
WolfCrypt's \texttt{asn.h} API provides a nearly complete collection of tools needed to generate certificate chains, encode certificates and private keys according to DER, then further encode them to PEM format. At the time of writing this thesis, WolfCrypt does not support signing a certificate signing request (CSR), but for benchmarking purposes I control the entire chain, and WolfCrypt does support directly signing the body of a certificate.

Modifying WolfCrypt's \texttt{asn.h} module to support KEM public key in a certificate is relatively straightforward. The only non-trivial obstacle comes from how WolfSSL handles OIDs. Object Identifier (OID) is a variable-length sequence of integers used to identify individual cryptographic primitives. For example, the OID for ML-KEM-512 is \texttt{2.16.840.1.101.3.4.4.1}. OID is included in an certificate to identify the public key and the signature; it is also included in the DER encoding of private keys. Having variable length makes OID tedious to work with when programming in C: unlike \texttt{NamedGroup}, which has fixed length that can be captured in a 16-bit integer, OID cannot be easily abstracted using a fixed-sized enum type. WolfSSL works around this limitation by using an ``OID sum'' algorithm, which computes an ``hash'' of an OID that fit into a 32-bit integer. Compressing variable-length integer sequence into a 32-bit integer carries with it the risk of collision, and in fact the first version of the OID summing algorithm indeed ran into a collision between SPHINCS-192-fast and SPHINCS-128-fast. A newer OID summing algortihm provided stronger collision resistance and resolved this issue. All OID sums are stored in a header file \texttt{oid\_sum.h}, which is generated by a Perl script.

\subsubsection{Implementing KEMTLS handshake}
KEMTLS handshake workflow is identical to TLS 1.3's handshake flow from the beginning until client starts processing server's \texttt{Certificate} message.
Even after KEMTLS and TLS 1.3's handshake flow diverges, they still share the format of the \texttt{Finished} message (which contains exactly one HMAC tag).
Finally, once the handshake is complete, TLS 1.3 and KEMTLS exchange application data in identical fashion.
The similarity between TLS 1.3 and KEMTLS handshake workflow allows us to reuse a significant part of WolfSSL's TLS 1.3 implementation, diverging at only a handful of places that are easy to reason about.
While working with a TLS library written in C is intimidating at first, this implementation strategy proved successful, and I was able to finish implementing KEMTLS in less than a month using only around 4600 lines of code change.

The \texttt{WOLFSSL} struct is used on both client-side and server-side and encodes the pair of client and server state as a global TLS state.
We begin modifying the TLS state machine by adding two flags \texttt{haveMlKemAuth} and \texttt{haveHqcAuth} to the main \texttt{WOLFSSL} struct.
In a unilaterally authenticated KEMTLS handshake, the two flags are set on the server side when the server loads a KEM private key.
Detecting a KEM private key is cleanly accomplished because at certificate generation, private keys are encoded according to DER, and the OID of the KEM scheme is included.
If the OID belongs to one of ML-KEM's variants, then \texttt{haveMlKemAuth} is set, and if the OID belongs to one of HQC's variants, then \texttt{haveHqcAuth} is set.
On the client side, these two flags are set when the client finds a ML-KEM or HQC public key in the certificate chain sent by the server.
The combination of these two flags is sufficient for deciding when the two peers are performing a KEMTLS or TLS 1.3 handshake, and all divergence between KEMTLS and TLS 1.3 handshake flow will be controlled by these two flags.

On the client side, KEMTLS and TLS 1.3 handshake flow first diverges after the client finishes processing server's \texttt{Certificate} message.
In signature-based TLS 1.3, client's immediate next step is to receive and process server's \texttt{CertificateVerify}, which contains a signature over the handshake transcript.
In KEMTLS, client's immediate next step is to construct and send a \texttt{KemCiphertext} message.
We followed the format used in the original KEMTLS implementation and let \texttt{KemCiphertext} contain only the ciphertext data with no metadata.
This is acceptable within the context of this project since the peer loads at most one private key at a time, though in production use a server might load multiple private key and may require \texttt{KemCiphertext} to contain metadata indicating which keypair should be used.

% \chapter{Observations}

% This would be a good place for some figures and tables.

% Some notes on figures and photographs\ldots

% \begin{itemize}
% \item A well-prepared PDF should be 
%   \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Of reasonable size, {\it i.e.} photos cropped and compressed.
%     \item Scalable, to allow enlargment of text and drawings. 
%   \end{enumerate} 
% \item Photos must be bit maps, and so are not scaleable by definition. TIFF and
% BMP are uncompressed formats, while JPEG is compressed. Most photos can be
% compressed without losing their illustrative value.
% \item Drawings that you make should be scalable vector graphics, \emph{not} 
% bit maps. Some scalable vector file formats are: EPS, SVG, PNG, WMF. These can
% all be converted into PNG or PDF, that pdflatex recognizes. Your drawing 
% package can probably export to one of these formats directly. Otherwise, a 
% common procedure is to print-to-file through a Postscript printer driver to 
% create a PS file, then convert that to EPS (encapsulated PS, which has a 
% bounding box to describe its exact size rather than a whole page). 
% Programs such as GSView (a Ghostscript GUI) can create both EPS and PDF from PS files.
% Appendix~\ref{AppendixA} shows how to generate properly sized Matlab plots and save them as PDF.
% \item It's important to crop your photos and draw your figures to the size that
% you want to appear in your thesis. Scaling photos with the 
% includegraphics command will cause loss of resolution. And scaling down 
% drawings may cause any text annotations to become too small.
