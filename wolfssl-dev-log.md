I want to add implementations of SPHINCS+ and Falcon to WolfSSL without using liboqs.

There are two workspaces to manage:
- `wolfssl`'s source code, located as a submodule under this project. I will not run `configure` within this source code. Instead, I will rely on `wolfssl/.clangd` to set macro flags when working on wolfssl source code.
- `server-wolfssl`, which will compile `wolfssl` using `server-wolfssl/config/user_settings.h` and its cmake setup. This is the primary place where I will be running tests the stuff
- `pico`, this is the final place where the wolfssl changes will go into
